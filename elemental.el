;; So, [[https://github.com/emacscollective/no-littering][no-littering]] is a package that will put files and directories that
;; usually are littered all over your ~.emacs.d~ into two directories in
;; ~.emacs.d~, ~var~ and ~etc~.

;; Backup

;; Without configuration, Emacs will store backup's of files you're
;; editing in the same directory as the file in question. Although, not a
;; bad idea in theory, you rarely need these backup's and they make a
;; mess with version-control etc. A better solution, is to keep all
;; backup's in a directory of it's own. This way, you can also delete
;; them all in a swoop if you're confident that they won't save your ass
;; down the line.

;; Garbage collection

;; Garbage Collection can make your Emacs instance crawl to a halt. To

;; Better safe than sorry

;; Most operating systems have a concept of trash. A temporary storage
